# FearTheLight mod context

- This is a **Minecraft Forge 1.20.1** mod.
- Use **Parchment** mappings (not official Mojang names) for parameters and docs.
- Try to not reinvent the wheel and use Java and Minecraft codebases as much as possible
- **Mixin** is used; follow existing mixin config and patterns in the project.
- Java 17. Build and run via Gradle (`runClient` / `runServer`).
- The mod itself is about adding the Daybreak event based off of SCP-001 "When Day Breaks"
